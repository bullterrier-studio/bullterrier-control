"""The pre-push hook: run the whole local gate (`uv run poe check`) when the push updates `main` or anything that is
not a branch (a tag), and skip it for any other branch.

Why: a feature branch is checked by CI when its pull request opens, so running the full gate on every push to it only
slows the work down. A direct push to `main` has no pull request in front of it, so the gate runs first, locally,
instead of leaving a red `main` for CI to find. pre-commit gives the hook the pushed ref in PRE_COMMIT_REMOTE_BRANCH
(for example `refs/heads/main`); when it is missing or is not a branch ref the gate runs: skipping is only for a
branch that is clearly not main.

A push that changes only documentation (the top-level and `docs/*.md` pages, the pictures in `docs/images/`) skips the
gate too: no code is in it, and CI still runs everything on the pushed `main`. The pushed range comes from
PRE_COMMIT_FROM_REF and PRE_COMMIT_TO_REF; when it cannot be read the gate runs.
