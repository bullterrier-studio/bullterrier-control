"""The pre-push hook: run the local gate when the push updates `main` or anything that is not a branch (a tag), or when
local `main` has code its remote-tracking branch lacks, and skip it for any other push. Two tiers: a push to a branch
runs `uv run poe check`; a tag, or a ref this hook cannot classify, runs `uv run poe full`, which also runs the gate
proofs (the tests marked `gate`, each proving that a gate fails on a known-bad input). `check` runs the proofs only when
the change touches what they test (`proofs`, below).

Why: a feature branch is checked by CI when its pull request opens, so running the full gate on every push to it only
slows the work down. A direct push to `main` has no pull request in front of it, so the gate runs first, locally,
instead of leaving a red `main` for CI to find. pre-commit gives the hook the pushed ref in PRE_COMMIT_REMOTE_BRANCH
(e.g. `refs/heads/main`); when it is missing or is not a branch ref the gate runs: skipping is only for a
branch that is clearly not main.

pre-commit reports only the first ref of a multi-ref push (`git push --all`, `git push origin feat/x main`), and which
comes first must not decide. So for any other branch the hook also asks git whether local `main` has commits
`<remote>/main` lacks (`<remote>` is PRE_COMMIT_REMOTE_NAME, default `origin`) and runs the gate if they hold code, or
if git cannot say. The cost, accepted: while local `main` has unpushed code, every push runs the gate. Limit: besides
the first ref and `main`, no ref is looked at; a later tag or branch with code `main` lacks goes unseen.

A push that changes only documentation (the top-level and `docs/*.md` pages, the pictures in `docs/images/`) skips the
gate too: no code is in it, and CI still runs everything on the pushed `main`. The pushed range comes from
PRE_COMMIT_FROM_REF and PRE_COMMIT_TO_REF; when it cannot be read the gate runs. A rename counts as a deletion and an
addition (`--no-renames`), so moving code into `docs/` still changes code.

A gate that already passed on exactly the pushed tree is not repeated. `uv run poe check` (and `full`) begins with
`python tools/pre_push.py start` and ends with `python tools/pre_push.py pass TIER`: the second
records the tree of `HEAD` and the tier in the git folder (never committed) only if the working tree was clean and
`HEAD`'s tree was the same at both moments, so the record names contents that were checked in full. A push whose tip
has that tree skips the gate if the pass was of the tier the push needs or a higher one (`full` covers `check`, never
the other way round); any other tree runs it. CI checks everything again.

`pre_push.py proofs` is the last gate step of `check`: it runs `poe gate-tests` when a file changed since the commit the
proofs last passed on (working tree and untracked files included) matches `[tool.gate-proofs] triggers` (or the
project's own `project-triggers`) in pyproject.toml, and when there is no such commit: skipping is only for a change
that clearly leaves the proofs' inputs alone. That commit is recorded in the git folder when the proofs pass on a clean
working tree, in this step or in `full`. Not the merge base with `origin/main`: the project pushes rarely, so that base
would hold weeks of work and the proofs would run on every `check`.

One gate runs per checkout: `start` also records the PID of the `poe` process running the gate, and refuses to begin
while a live `poe` process holds that record (two gates in one checkout share its build folder and double the memory
they take). A record left by a gate that died names a dead process, or one that is no longer `poe`, and is ignored.
Where `ps` is missing (Windows) nothing is recorded and nothing is refused.
