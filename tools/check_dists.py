"""Check a folder of built distributions as PyPI and an install would see them: `poe build-check` runs it on the sdist
and wheel it just built, the build workflow on the sdist and every platform's wheel.

Run in the project (its pyproject.toml says where the package and its Rust extension live):

    python tools/check_dists.py FOLDER

- twine (`check --strict`) on every file: the metadata, and the description as PyPI renders it.
- Each wheel holds exactly one build of the extension (`[tool.maturin] module-name`), for its platform.
- check-wheel-contents on each wheel against the package tree as an install from that wheel has it: the package
  (`[tool.check-wheel-contents] package`, its omissions applied) with that wheel's extension in place of any local
  build. A file in the wheel that the tree lacks (a template, a picture, a test) fails (W102), and so does code of the
  tree that the wheel left out (W101).

Exit code 0 when every check passes; 1 otherwise, each failure's report on stderr. Standard library only, besides the
two tools it runs.
