"""Which file of the release artifact the installed bullterrier-control came from: the build workflow's smoke install
runs it with the fresh environment's own Python, so a pass proves the files about to be published work, not a release
from PyPI and not a build made on the fly.

    python check_installed.py ARTIFACT --from wheel|sdist

- `wheel`: the installed extension is, byte for byte, the one in exactly one wheel of ARTIFACT; that wheel is named.
- `sdist`: the package was built from ARTIFACT's sdist: its direct_url.json (PEP 610) names that file.

Exit code 0 and the file's name on stdout; 1 and the reason on stderr otherwise. Standard library only: the
environment under test holds the package and its dependencies, nothing else.

Interface:
    installed_from(distribution, artifact, kind) -> the artifact's file; raises InstallError saying why not
    main(argv)                                   -> exit code
