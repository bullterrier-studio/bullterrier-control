"""Release a version in one command: check, show the plan, ask, then bump, write the changelog section, commit, tag and
push main and the tag together.

    uv run poe release VERSION [--dry-run] [--yes]

VERSION is chosen by the person releasing, never computed: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, optionally with aN, bN or rcN, as
release.yml accepts it (0.2.0rc1 is published to TestPyPI, 0.2.0 to PyPI).

Before changing anything, the script refuses, listing every reason, unless: HEAD is `main` and the tree is clean; after
a fetch, main is neither behind nor diverged from `origin/main` (commits ahead of it are pushed with the release);
VERSION is greater (PEP 440) than the version in pyproject.toml and than every `v*` tag, and no file under tests/
writes it (the tag's CI would fail on such a test); the new changelog section passes tools/check_release.py, the rules
release.yml applies to the pushed tag; `ci-ok` has not failed on GitHub for HEAD (asked through `gh`; a missing or
offline gh, or a commit GitHub has no result for yet, is a warning: release.yml runs the whole CI on the tag before it
publishes anything); and `poe check` passes. Then it prints the plan and asks `[y/N]`: `--yes` answers yes for
scripts, `--dry-run` stops after the plan. Releasing runs `uv version VERSION` (pyproject.toml and uv.lock), writes
CHANGELOG.md, commits `chore(release): vVERSION`, creates the annotated tag `vVERSION` and runs
`git push --atomic origin main vVERSION` (never a force-push), then prints where the release workflow runs and which
environment to approve.

The section: one already in CHANGELOG.md for VERSION, written by hand, is kept and its `Unreleased` becomes today's
date. A pre-release of a version whose section is drafted by hand (`## [0.2.0] - Unreleased`) takes the draft's text,
and the draft stays for the release. Otherwise git-cliff writes it from the Conventional Commits since the last
release (configured in `[tool.git-cliff]` in pyproject.toml). A new section goes above the first released one, below
any draft, and its compare link joins the link definitions at the bottom.

Run from the repository root (poe does that). Exit code: 0 released (or the dry run passed), 1 refused or cancelled
(nothing was changed; the reasons are on stderr), 2 failed after the release commit was made (nothing was pushed, or
the push failed; stderr says how to push again or undo).

Interface for tests: `literal_versions(version, folder)`, the scan behind the tests/ rule.
