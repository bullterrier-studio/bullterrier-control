"""tools/check_installed.py: the build workflow's smoke install names the file of the release artifact that the
installed package came from, and fails when it came from anywhere else.

An installed distribution is a dist-info folder beside the package's files (`importlib.metadata.Distribution.at`); the
artifact is a folder of wheels and an sdist. Both are written here, as an installer and a build would leave them.
