"""tools/check_dists.py: a folder of built distributions passes only when twine accepts every file and each wheel holds
the package's code, one build of its extension for its platform, and nothing else.

The distributions are a tiny package's, written here file by file as a build backend would (no build: a wheel is a zip
with its metadata and RECORD), in a project whose pyproject.toml configures check-wheel-contents and maturin as ours
does. Each bad case changes one thing of the good set.
