"""The dead-code gate can fail: vulture, run with the project's configuration, rejects an unused function and an unused
class, and passes the package as it is (so it is not noise that people learn to ignore).

An architecture test of the tooling: its subject is the `[tool.vulture]` configuration in pyproject.toml, so it runs
vulture the way `uv run poe check` does, on a copy of the package into which the dead code is written.
