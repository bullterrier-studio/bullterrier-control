"""The warning gate can fail: run the way `uv run poe test` runs it, a test that leaks a file, or writes text in the
locale's encoding instead of UTF-8, fails, and a clean one passes.

An architecture test of the tooling: its subject is the `filterwarnings` setting and the `test` task in pyproject.toml,
so it runs that task, through poe, on a probe test file in a copy of the configuration.
