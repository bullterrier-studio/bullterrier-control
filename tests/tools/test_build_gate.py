"""The build gate can fail: `poe build-check` builds the sdist and the wheel and rejects a distribution PyPI would
refuse to render (twine), and a wheel with a file that cannot be imported or with anything but the library's code (a
picture, a test: check-wheel-contents), and passes the project as it is.

An architecture test of the tooling: its subject is the `build-check` task in pyproject.toml, so it runs that task, the
way `uv run poe check` does, in a copy of the project into which one fault at a time is written.
