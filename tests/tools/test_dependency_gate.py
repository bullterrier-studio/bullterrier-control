"""The dependency gate can fail: deptry, run with the project's configuration, rejects library code that imports a
package the project does not declare, or one declared only for development, and passes the package as it is.

An architecture test of the tooling: its subject is the `[tool.deptry]` configuration in pyproject.toml, so it runs
deptry the way `uv run poe check` does, on a copy of the package into which the offending import is written.
