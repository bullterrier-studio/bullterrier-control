# Template decisions

The reasons behind what the template shares, once: this file is the template's (`copier update` keeps it current). The
rules themselves are in `rules.md`; this project's own decisions are in `design-decisions.md`.

## Platforms

- **One abi3 wheel per platform** (`abi3-py312`): Linux x86_64 and aarch64 (in the manylinux 2_28 container of the runner's own
  architecture, so nothing is cross-compiled), macOS arm64 and x86_64 (the latter cross-compiled on the arm64 runner), Windows
  x86_64, plus the sdist. *Reason:* one wheel serves every supported Python, and the pure-Rust core has no platform code.
- **Every wheel is installed on its own platform from the built file alone and run** before anything is published; the sdist is
  built and run on Linux. *Reason:* a wheel that builds can still fail to load.
- **No build cache in the jobs that build what may be published.** *Reason:* nothing restored from a cache goes into a release.

## The core is pure Rust

`crates/core` has no PyO3 and no numpy (`deny.toml` bans them outside the bindings, an architecture test scans `src/`), forbids
unsafe code, and builds for `wasm32-unknown-unknown` (`rust-wasm`). *Reason:* the logic runs without Python or the GIL, in a
browser, and is tested without an interpreter; the bindings are a mapping that can be read in minutes.

## The core's tests are one binary, black-box by default

Every `tests/*.rs` is an executable of its own, which macOS scans on first launch (12 s measured, more under load: 62 binaries
made one `cargo test` take 18 minutes). So `tests/it/main.rs` holds a module per area, and `rust-test-layout`
(`tools/check_rust_test_layout.py`, the table `[tool.rust-tests.own-binaries]`) fails a stray binary, a listed file without its
`//! Own binary: <why>` first line, a stale listing, a `[[test]]` target outside the listing, a module `main.rs` does not declare,
and `autotests = false` beside a `tests/it/`. A test is in `tests/it/` unless no public route reaches what it checks (a private
kernel, a `pub(crate)` item): then it stays inline. *Reason:* a test through the public contract survives a refactor of the
internals, and widening an item to `pub` to move a test out would make the API larger for the tests' sake. *Cost:* a helper both
sides need exists twice. Bindings have `test = false` (the Python suite tests them) and doctests are off (each is an executable
too).

## Tests run under a memory cap, not an allocator in the binary

Every task that runs tests (`poe rust-test`, `test`, `gate-tests`) goes through `tools/run_capped.py`, which sums the resident memory of the whole process group ten
times a second and kills it past `cap-mb` (exit 99; a deadline is 98). *Reason:* runaway tests reached 43, 57 and 152 GB and
froze the machine; a timeout limits seconds, not memory. A cap on the group covers every binary, doctests and children, where an
allocator in one binary covered only that binary, and the crate needs no dev-dependency for it. The runner's own tests kill a
known-bad allocation. It is not enforced on Windows (no process groups or `ps`); the CI legs there run uncapped.

## Three tiers; a gate that passed is not repeated on the same tree

`fast` (the inner loop), `check` (everything but the gate proofs, which run when a change since they last passed touches what they test) and `full` (`check` and
the proofs, for a tag and in CI). *Reason:* the proofs, tests that copy the workspace and build in it to show each gate fails on a known-bad
input, were most of a gate that took 19 minutes in a sibling project; a library change cannot break a gate's ability to fail, so they need
running when the gates or their inputs change, and always before a release. *Cost:* a proof broken from outside its triggers shows in CI or at
the release, not at the push.

`poe check` and `full` note the tree of `HEAD` when they start and, when every step passed, record it with the tier in the git folder if the
working tree was clean at both ends and `HEAD` was unchanged; the pre-push hook skips the gate for a tip with that tree, if the pass was of
the tier the push needs or a higher one (`full` covers `check`, never the reverse). *Reason:* the hook
repeated a minutes-long gate on contents just checked, and a slow loop gets worked around. *Not seen by the record:* state outside
the tree (installed cargo tools, the advisory database, the built extension); CI checks everything again.

## No runtime dependency

The package installs with nothing but its wheel. *Reason:* every dependency is something to audit, resolve and ship; add one with
its reason here.
